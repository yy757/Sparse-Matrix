 *>>> Condition :
 *      1. For the Cholesky Decomposition, the matrix has to be symmetric, positive definite matrix
 *      but doesn't has to be diagonal dominant, which means does not have to be a small condition number
 *      2. For the Gaussian elimination, the matrix must be well-conditioned, which has a small condition number
 *      Usually, we make it diagonal dominant.

 *  Testing method :
 *      Use backward substitution
