>>> Input file :
	bcsstm20.mtx

>>> Condition :
	1. For the Cholesky Decomposition, the matrix has to be symmetric, positive definite matrix
	   but doesn't has to be diagonal dominant, which means does not have to be a small condition number
	2. For the Gaussian elimination, the matrix must be well-conditioned, which has a small condition number
	   Usually, we make it diagonal dominant.

>>> Paramaters :
	1. Matrix : Sparse Matrix  <input>
	2. b : Input right hand side  <input>  b = [1,1,1,1,...,1]
	3. RHS : Calculated right hand side  <output>
	4. norm : norm of the vector b and RHS  <output>
	5. condition : the condition number of the matrix <output>
	6. if symmetric : close to 0 means symmetric while large number means asymmetric <output>
	7. sum of matrix : check the sum of all elements in the matrix to ensure the correctness
		           close 0 means right while large number means wrong.

>>> Methods :
	1. Cholesky Decomposition
	2. Gaussian Elimination

>>> Testting :
	Back substitution : check the norm of RHS and b
